1. Input iterator
  - read access for the pointed to element
  - dereference (operator* or operator->) to access element
  - can advance in forward direction (operator++, e.g. it++)
2. Output iterator
  - write access for the pointed to element
3. Forward iterator
  - has to satisfy input iterator. if mutable, has to also satisfy output iterator
  - allows multiple passes (multiple passes through a list)
4. Bidirectional iterator
  - has to satisfy forward iterator. if mutable, has to also satisfy output iterator
  - can go backwards (it--)
5. Random-access iterator
  - can be moved to point to any element in constant time (it + num, it - num is constant)
